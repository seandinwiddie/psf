## User Stories BDD

The user stories portrayed in the `psf.js` file with BDD scenario syntax ("Given-When-Then") are as follows:

1. Initial Data Collection:
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user observes interactions of PSF with their operating system functionalities,
     Then the user can assign a progress rating between -5 and 5 based on observed alignment.
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user assigns a progress rating and priority,
     Then the user can optionally note any observations.
   
2. Data Entry:
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user uses the `map` function to transform progress ratings,
     Then a new array with formatted progress ratings is created.
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user uses the `map` function to transform notes,
     Then a new array with observation notes is created.

3. Chart Creation:
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user combines units, progress ratings, and observation notes using the `zip` function,
     Then a combined array is created.
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user formats chart data using the `reduce` function,
     Then a text-based table is created.
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user displays the formatted chart,
     Then the progress chart is shown.

4. Periodic Updates:
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user prompts for a new progress rating and note using the `getInput` function,
     Then the user can enter the new values.
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user appends the new rating to ratings using the `concat` function,
     Then the new rating is added to the list.
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user appends the new note to notes using the `concat` function,
     Then the new note is added to the list.

5. Visual Analysis:
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user uses the `map` function to convert ratings into a formatted string,
     Then a string for visualizing progress ratings is created.
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user displays the string,
     Then progress ratings are visualized.

6. Adaptation:
   - Given the PSF is running,
     When the user analyzes ratings using the `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` functions,
     Then strategies are modified using a functional approach to drive improvement.

These scenarios capture the different interactions and functionalities described in the code. Each scenario follows the "Given-When-Then" format, where the initial context is provided (Given), an action is taken (When), and the expected outcome is stated (Then).

## notes

using repetitive mental rehearsals to instill positive changes in thoughts, actions, way of being, etc

reflects the notion of "reprogramming" the mind, like installing and iterating new software programs in the brain

these mental rehearsals conscious efforts to reshape ingrained behaviors and thought patterns

consistently practicing mental exercises, creates new neural pathways that gradually overwrite old patterns, leading to a more positive and purposeful way of living

the "brain of records" symbolizes the accumulation of experiences and memories that shape current mindset

"Maps of the futures" represent the visualization of desired outcomes and goals

repeatedly rehearse these mental scenarios, running a new background software that gradually becomes habitual, transforming habits into an improved versions

as custom software enhances a device's functionality, intentional mental practice enhances growth and well-being

gradual transmission of attitudes, behaviors, or ideas

as substances passively diffuse across a membrane in osmosis, actions, energy, and demeanor subtly influence

consistent behaviors and the energy projected have a subliminal impact on others, shaping perceptions and inspiring to adopt traits or behaviors

actions and attitudes have a ripple effect, even if not actively trying to influence

being mindful of the kind of energy and behaviors emited, as such indirectly shapes experiences and reactions

updating the operating system allegorically symbolizes growth and transformation

as technology benefits from software updates to enhance performance and security, engage in a process of improvement and evolution

like updating software to gain new features, acquiring new knowledge and skills can expand capabilities and perspectives

similar to debugging and optimizing code, introspection and awareness help identify areas for improvement in behavior and mindset

outdated software is replaced, pruning destructive habits, beliefs, and emotional baggage is crucial for growth

regular updates keep technology current and secure

consistently seeking growth ensures ongoing development

staying open to change, embracing learning, and actively seeking ways to refine

"Downloading and installing" implies the process of sharing knowledge, values, or ideas influencing and shaping beliefs and behaviors

imparting information, insights, perspectives, etc

providing new file or piece of knowledge that integrates into previous understanding

as software is installed to alter a device's functionality, sharing thoughts and experiences can potentially influence perception and interaction

this allegory highlights the power of communication and influence

the effectiveness of "downloading and installing" depends on various factors, including the receptiveness

like any software installation, the process should be respectful and considerate of the recipient's current/present autonomy and beliefs

monitoring progress status represents tracking growth, achievements, goals, etc

as software provides progress updates during installations or tasks, keeping track of progress is essential for sustaining energy and making informed decisions

monitoring software installation, tracking progress helps see how far we have or one has come and assess what remains to be done

if an installation encounters issues, software adapts or alerts the user

monitoring progress allows to adjust strategies or set new targets if encounter challenges

software provides data on installation steps, monitoring progress helps make decisions based on real-time feedback about growth journey

progress bars in software show incremental completion

tracking progress visually reinforces achievements, propels motivates, perpetuates inertia

while monitoring progress is important, it's equally crucial to acknowledge that growth isn't always linear

setbacks and plateaus are natural, and consistency, adaptation, and a growth mindset contribute to successful development

subtle transmission of growth and progress, leading to naturally assess development

osmosis implies a passive transfer, growth and progress influences subtly, without direct intention

actions and behavior inspire to reflect on paths

software updates display progress status, development journey serves as an example to observe and evaluate growth

journey prompt to become more aware of strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, like a software update prompts users to consider the state of their devices

impact of actions and growth, encouraging to engage in reflection, development, etc

growth benefits also inspire positive change journey observance

influencing through growth journey

similar to osmosis, development journey subtly influences, prompting to examine progress, potential, etc

just as software updates are monitored, growth serves as a model for to gauge advancement

growth journey introduces new thought patterns and perspectives, encouraging to consider and adopt alternative ways of thinking

symbolizes the accumulation of past experiences and future aspirations in mind, reflecting goals

software running in the background, the gradual integration of new behaviors becomes habitual, shaping consistent actions

allegory emphasizes the transformative power of development, highlighting how journey can inspire and influence, subtly guiding to introspect, learn, and evolve

tracking and quantifying growth and achievements, monitoring the metrics of a process

progress is charted in various fields, keeping track of development and accomplishments

as metrics provide tangible data, observations and assessments offer a quantifiable way to evaluate growth

using metrics to guide decision-making, the allegory suggests that observing progress can inform about how adapting and where need support

charts and graphs visually represent progress

creating a mental or metaphorical chart that reflects advancement

while measurement can provide valuable insights, growth is multidimensional and subjective

support journeys, providing encouragement and guidance while allowing for the uniqueness of each path

a direct and systematic approach to self-improvement, similar to issuing commands in a computer terminal

input commands in a terminal, are issuing clear instructions for growth and change

executing commands produces specific results, taking deliberate actions based on instructions can lead to desired changes

as a terminal provides real-time feedback, monitoring progress and adjusting actions can create a feedback loop for continuous improvement

the allegory emphasizes a structured and focused approach, aligning with the methodical nature of working with a command-line terminal
